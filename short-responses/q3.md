# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer

Static assets are files that do not change dynamically and are served to the client exactly as stored on the server. These include HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, as well as images, videos, fonts, and documents.

In a React project, static assets are produced during the build process. The `.jsx` files are converted to `.js` files to create these assets. The resulting files are stored in the `build` or `dist` directory, ready for deployment to a server.
