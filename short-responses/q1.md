# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer

Middleware functions sit between the request and the final route handler, allowing modifications of the request, response, or execute additional logic.

Middleware functions intercept and process requests before they reach the controller, allowing for actions like logging, authentication, or modifying the request or response. They do not typically send a response but pass control to the next middleware or the final controller.

A controller, on the other hand, is responsible for processing the request at a specific route and sending the appropriate response back to the client.

TDLR:

Middleware functions intercept and can modify requests or responses but don't finalize the response.

Controllers are endpoint handlers responsible for delivering the final response.
